          <p>
            Hello! My name is Sharon Gilman, a recent Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate from North Carolina State University 
            with a passion for building scalable programs. With experience in Java, Javascript, Python, and React, I love creating 
            engaging, user-friendly web experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing video games. My goal is to continually grow as a developer and 
            make meaningful contributions to the projects I work on.
