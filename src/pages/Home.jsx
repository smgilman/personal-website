                            Hello! My name is Sharon Gilman. I am a recent Industrial and Systems Engineering graduate from 
                            North Carolina State University with a passion for building scalable programs. I have experience 
                            in Java, Javascript, Python, and React.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing video games. My goal is to continually 
                            grow as a developer and make meaningful contributions to the projects I work on.
                        </p>
